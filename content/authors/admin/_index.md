    summary: |
      I led the development of a conversational agent and Natural Language Processing (NLP) solution for Voyages-SNCF.com, a premier train travel booking platform. To kick off this initiative, I directed the integration of the bot with Facebook Messenger. Since the public launch of the Messenger Bot, we have seen a significant rise in user engagement. The conversational bot allows users to inquire about options directly within the chat and seamlessly book their train tickets by being redirected to the checkout page on voyages-sncf.com. This innovative search and booking experience resulted in an impressive 50% increase in bookings.
